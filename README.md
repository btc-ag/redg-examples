# RedG examples

This is a collection of small examples. It demonstrates compatibility with
different database systems and shows how to use certain features.

Each of the examples assumes a local database running. You need to input the
credentials into the `pom.xml` and into the Java test file. 
**Do this only for testing purposes. Do not save valid credentials in code files!**

Consult the `README.md` file for special instructions for each example module.

Currently has examples for usage of RedG with

 - H2 databases
 - Oracle databases
 - MySQL databases
 - PostgreSQL databases
